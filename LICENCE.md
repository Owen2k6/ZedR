The following restrictions on utilising this plugin are below.

This licence governs the use of ZedR ("the Software") for Minecraft. By using, modifying, or distributing this Software, you agree to comply with the following restrictions:

1. Prohibited Uses

1.1. Malicious Intent: The Software may not be used for any malicious purposes, including but not limited to:

Disrupting or damaging servers, player experiences, or Minecraft ecosystems.

Exploiting vulnerabilities in server software or the Minecraft game.

1.2. Misrepresentation of Server Activity:

The Software may not be used to falsely inflate the appearance of server activity or player counts.

NPCs created by the Software must not be presented as real players in any server list or external tool.

2. Clear Identification of NPCs

2.1. Naming Convention:

All NPCs created using the Software must be clearly identified as non-player characters by using the prefix "&" before their name (e.g., "&Jack").

This prefix must not be removed, obscured, or replaced in any context.

2.2. Identification Requirement:

Visual distinction of NPCs is not required due to the limitations of Minecraft beta versions. The "&" prefix in the name serves as the sole method of identifying NPCs, and no attempts to obscure or bypass this naming convention are permitted.

3. Ethical Use

3.1. Transparency:

Server operators must disclose to players that NPCs are powered by the ZedR system and are not real players. This information must be made available on server websites, rules, or in-game documentation.

3.2. Respect for Privacy:

The Software must not collect, store, or use any player data for purposes other than operating the NPCs.

No ZedR-driven NPC behaviour shall mimic or impersonate real players without consent.

4. Distribution and Modification

4.1. Attribution:

Any distribution or modification of the Software must credit the original creator(s) and include this licence.

4.2. No Circumvention:

Modifications to the Software must not circumvent or violate these licence restrictions.

5. Enforcement

5.1. Revocation of Rights:

Any breach of this licence will result in the immediate revocation of the right to use, modify, or distribute the Software.

5.2. Reporting Violations:

Users are encouraged to report any violations of these restrictions to the original creator(s) for review.

5.3. Legal Consequences:

Failure to comply with this licence constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights and may result in a DMCA takedown or other legal actions. This includes but is not limited to improper use, modification, or distribution of the Software.

By using ZedR, you agree to these terms and conditions. Non-compliance may result in legal action, including but not limited to enforcement through a DMCA takedown.
